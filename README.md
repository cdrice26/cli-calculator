# CLI Calculator

This is a command-line utility that acts as a calculator. You can enter standard math expressions and this program will evaluate them and print their result to the console. You can also pass in the expression as a command-line argument.

## Installation

Clone the repo, and run the following in the root of it:
```zsh
lein uberjar
```
This will build a jar in the ```target/uberjar``` that you can then run with:
```zsh
java -jar calculator-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar
```

## Usage
To run in REPL mode, run
```zsh
java -jar calculator-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar
```
This will continuously take input from ```stdin``` until quit with ```^C``` or by typing ```quit```, and evaluate each expression and print the result on the next line.

You can also pass in an expression as a command-line argument, e.g.
```zsh
java -jar calculator-0.1.0-SHAPSHOT-standalone.jar "3+(4abs(5))"
```
